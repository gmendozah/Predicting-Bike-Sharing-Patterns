# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Installation
This project requires **Python 3.6.0** and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `intro-to-machine-learning-with-pytorch/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb
```

or
```bash
jupyter notebook Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb.ipynb
```

on any Jupyter Notebook.
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
